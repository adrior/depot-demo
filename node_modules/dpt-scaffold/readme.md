# Dpt-scaffold

Scaffolding tool for _dpt_ framework. Dpt-scaffold copies files from a template directory and replaces all variables with user input.

## Creating templates

A template is a directory that has a valid `.scaffold.json` file in it.

## Usage

Dpt-scaffold can be used as a CLI tool or in a Node application.

### As a CLI tool

Install Dpt-scaffold globally:

```
npm install -g dpt-scaffold
```

Call it:

```
dpt-scaffold <template> [destination]
```

If the path to the template is relative, the program will look for the template in the current working path as well as in `~/.templates/` directory.
